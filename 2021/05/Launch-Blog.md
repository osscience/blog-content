# Announcing OSScience.org, a curated spotlight on good practice in research code and hardware

Software, hardware tooling, and code are integral to research. 7 out of 10 researchers report that they couldn't work without software, and scientific hardware is typically forbiddingly expensive to purchase and maintain. 

## Sharing work openly makes science stronger
In many cases, the software, code, or scripts used by researchers form part of their scientific method, aka a [protocol](https://www.protocols.io/what-is-protocol). Research method needs to be clear and well-described, such that other researchers can peer-review and/or repeat the work. 
. 
An effective way to make sure that research code is peer-reviewable and re-usable is to put it online, and [add a licence that permits re-use](https://choosealicense.com/) - aka making it [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd). 

Science needs open hardware, too. Instructions to make machines and tooling to perform science can also be shared openly - and in the context of research and science, this can make a massive impact, especially when using readily available materials that are accessible from any common setting. The [Global Open Source Hardware Manifesto](https://openhardware.science/gosh-manifesto/) explains this better than we ever could.

## Shining a spotlight on the good
Making your work open source isn't always as straightforward as simply putting it online, though - [many barriers exist that may make it harder to share](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-12-17-ten-arguments-against-open-science-you-can-win) (institutional, cultural, and personal), and even if the code is online, there is a range of ways to make sharing more effective and useful for others, from writing good documentation, creating automated testing pipelines to prevent bugs re-occuring, making it easy for others to report bugs or contribute new features, incredible training, great accessibility or internationalisation features, or building a community of users or developers. 

OSScience.org represents a curated view into what makes open source science good, including "[good enough](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)" practices, recognising that few projects are perfect but many have specific elements that demonstrate good standards.

## Call for editors and collaborators
Read more about the [editor positions](https://osscience.org/become-a-guest-editor-6cb2d53c08ca) available. To apply, please email O.Science@wellcome.org to express your interest, and a short statement why you think you're a good candidate. We expressly do NOT require a PhD or information about the number of scientific publications - instead we're looking for people with experience in open source software development, documentation, community management, and leadership.
